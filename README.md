# Spotify-Clone
 Build a web-based music player mimicking Spotify with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features include playback controls (play, pause, next, previous), volume adjustment, and a progress bar. Users can play songs from a dynamic playlist. This project emphasizes responsive design and hands-on web development skills.
